This year, I have decided to write review for year 2015. Idea is to list all the accomplishments of 2015 and things need focus in future.


##Books 
I am not a good reader especially English literature.  I always feel that I should read more. So this year I have made some progress. I listened couple of audio books and finished couple of books.

I have also brought a Kindle this year and it’s really helping me to pace up with my reading.

- [Anna Kareninia](http://amzn.to/1PG8Kl7, "Anna Kareninia") - Audio + Physical
- [Zero to One](http://amzn.to/1PG8YJ8, "Zero to One") - audio
- [1984](http://amzn.to/1TsEJez, "1984 by George Orwell") - Audio
- [My experiments with truths: An Autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi](http://amzn.to/1PG9aIs, "An Autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi") - Kindle
- [Daily Ritual: How Great Minds Make Time, Find Inspiration, and Get to Work]("http://amzn.to/20yQZfx")  - Not completed 
- [Solving procrastination puzzle]("http://amzn.to/20yR0Af")
- [Rehan Per Ragghu](http://amzn.to/1m35A3q)

This year I want to maintain
[a list of books which I want to read in 2016]({filename}/book-reading-list-for-2016.md).

##Meditation

In year 2015 I have decided to try meditation, but not able to do it on regular basis. I can feel all the benefits whenever I have continued for couple of days. It’s not miracle, but has some really good benefits. I have spent too much time on selecting the methodologies.

Focus of this year will be doing to on regular basis. I’ll start with 15 min a single sitting and then extend it for two settings, one in morning and another in evening.


##Produtivity
I am a long term procrastinator. For me starting a task is always a struggle. Once I get started I can work hour long without any problem. That's why I started most of my tasks when deadline is hitting at my head.

So far I am not able to identify a good solution to deal with my daily procrastination. I think meditation might help me to deal with my negative emotions during the procrastination.


##Career
I think there is not much progress. I am almost working on same set of technologies and with same client and company. 

This year my focus will be have couple of more skills under the belt
- Data Science - It’s a big topic, but my focus will be to complete couple of books and some introductory courses on courser.

- Understanding Docker 



##Traval

Normally I don't travel much. This year I spend 5 days with my family at Udaipur and Mount Abu. It was great family trip and we all enjoyed a lot.

This year again I’ll plan something at the end of year.
