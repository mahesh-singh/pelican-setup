  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>This year, I have decided to write review for year 2015. Idea is to list all the accomplishments of 2015 and things need focus in future.</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I am not a good reader especially English literature.  I always feel that I should read more. So this year I have made some progress. I listened couple of audio books and finished couple of books.</p>
<p>I have also brought a Kindle this year and it’s really helping me to pace up with my reading.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1PG8Kl7," title="Anna Kareninia">Anna Kareninia</a> - Audio + Physical</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1PG8YJ8," title="Zero to One">Zero to One</a> - audio</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1TsEJez," title="1984 by George Orwell">1984</a> - Audio</li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1PG9aIs," title="An Autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi">My experiments with truths: An Autobiography of Mahatma Gandhi</a> - Kindle</li>
<li><a href="" title="http://amzn.to/20yQZfx">Daily Ritual: How Great Minds Make Time, Find Inspiration, and Get to Work</a>  - Not completed </li>
<li><a href="" title="http://amzn.to/20yR0Af">Solving procrastination puzzle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.to/1m35A3q">Rehan Per Ragghu</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This year I want to maintain
<a href="http://maheshsingh.org/book-reading-list-for-2016.html">a list of books which I want to read in 2016</a>.</p>
<h2>Meditation</h2>
<p>In year 2015 I have decided to try meditation, but not able to do it on regular basis. I can feel all the benefits whenever I have continued for couple of days. It’s not miracle, but has some really good benefits. I have spent too much time on selecting the methodologies.</p>
<p>Focus of this year will be doing to on regular basis. I’ll start with 15 min a single sitting and then extend it for two settings, one in morning and another in evening.</p>
<h2>Produtivity</h2>
<p>I am a long term procrastinator. For me starting a task is always a struggle. Once I get started I can work hour long without any problem. That's why I started most of my tasks when deadline is hitting at my head.</p>
<p>So far I am not able to identify a good solution to deal with my daily procrastination. I think meditation might help me to deal with my negative emotions during the procrastination.</p>
<h2>Career</h2>
<p>I think there is not much progress. I am almost working on same set of technologies and with same client and company. </p>
<p>This year my focus will be have couple of more skills under the belt
- Data Science - It’s a big topic, but my focus will be to complete couple of books and some introductory courses on courser.</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding Docker </li>
</ul>
<h2>Traval</h2>
<p>Normally I don't travel much. This year I spend 5 days with my family at Udaipur and Mount Abu. It was great family trip and we all enjoyed a lot.</p>
<p>This year again I’ll plan something at the end of year.</p>
